This challenge has been done using JavaScript on Node server with Express wrapper around the HTTP server.
Transactions are persisted on a json file called transactions.json for simplicity of this challenge.
I've created a collection of API's that can be used to test this assignment in Postman.
I've attached the JSON file of the API's which can be imported into your POSTMAN application to test the available URLs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open POSTMAN and hit CMND+O to import and hit the Upload Files button and select the json file fetch_rewards.postman_collection.json from the directory.

Now, follow the sequence of API's in the collection to test the application.

Thank You....
